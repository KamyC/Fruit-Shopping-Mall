# Online Fruit Shopping Mall (Ongoing)

1. Using Node.js and Express.js for the routes and server.
2. I have finished the following :
   - The front-end UI and cart
   - routers to direct to different pages
   - styles for each html files
   - integrated AngularJS and MySQL to the server
3. Next Step:
   - Replace html with ejs file. Less hardcoding in front end side
   - Trying to create REST api for front end which reduces queries to the database
